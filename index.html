I’d highly recommend Joel if if you want positive changes to your body as well as mind.</p>

										<h3>15 month Transformation</h3>
										<p>I met Joel when I hit a plateau. I had been training but couldn't shift any more weight. Joel changed my nutritional habits and gave me a program to follow that would help me lose fat.

										<h3>7 month Transformation</h3>
										<p>Joel trained me at home and brought equipment with him. I lost a stone and a half in 7 months with changing my nutritional habits and training more often.

							<h2>About Joel</h2>
							<p>Joel is a highly empathetic, genuine and warm-hearted Personal Trainer who works with energy and integrative talking therapy techniques to engage with clients profoundly. As a world class personal trainer he engages both the mind and body to educate clients on a deeper level, resulting in significant transformations.</p>

							<p>As a trainee psychologist he is able to assess behavioural patterns and eliminate obstacles getting in the way of client goals. Whether you are someone new to exercise, a world class athlete or someone in between, he has a personal approach to suit each client he works with.</p>

							<p>With over twenty years of experience working with celebrities, young professionals, health care workers and CEO's he believes in small sustainable lifestyle changes rather than short term quick fixes. Quick fixes do not work because successfully reaching fitness goals takes time, effort and dedication (concepts that are foreign in today’s “I want it now” culture).</p>

							<p>His charisma, passion and drive will keep you on track getting the best out of you.</p>

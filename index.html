							<h2>About Joel</h2>
							<p>Joel is a highly empathetic, genuine and warm-hearted personal trainer who works with energy and talking therapy techniques to engage with clients profoundly. He is a strong mental health advocate who coaches both the mind and body to educate clients on a deeper level, resulting in significant transformations.</p>

							<p>As a trainee psychologist he is able to assess behavioural patterns to eliminate obstacles getting in the way of client goals. Taking the time to find out what motivates each client combined with an openness to share his personal challenges put clients at ease because he truly understands growth and development is a personal process.</p>

							<p>With over twenty years of experience working with celebrities, young professionals, health care workers and CEO's he believes in small sustainable lifestyle changes rather than short term quick fixes. Quick fixes do not work because successfully reaching fitness goals takes time, effort and dedication (concepts that are foreign in today’s “I want it now” culture).</p>

							<p>His charisma, passion and drive will keep you on track getting the best out of you.</p>
